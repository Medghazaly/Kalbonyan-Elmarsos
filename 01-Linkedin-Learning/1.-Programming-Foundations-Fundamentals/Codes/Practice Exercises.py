#                          Practice Exercises
# Here are a few small programs to help you understand the output of different lines of code.

# 1. What’s the output of the following program?

print("Practice Exercise 1:")

# A message for the user
message = "This is going to be tricky. ;)"

Message = "Very tricky!"  # Who will print this
print(Message)

# Perform mathematical operations

result = 2**3
print("2**3 =", result)  # This Equal 8

result = 5 - 3
print("5 - 3 =", result)  # This Equal 2

# 2. What’s the output of the following program?

print("Practice Exercise 2:")

message = "Hope you're having fun!"
# This will print (The message Hope you're having fun!)
print("The message", message)

# Perform mathematical operations
answer = 5+2**3
print("the answer is:", answer)  # This Will Print 13

# This will not print cause has a Commant
result = 5 - 3
# print(“5 - 3 =”, result)

print("Done!")
